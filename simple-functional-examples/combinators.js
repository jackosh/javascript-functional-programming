// In functional programming, a combinator is a higher-order function that takes functions as arguments and returns functions as results. Combinators are used to build more complex functions by composing simpler ones, without relying on mutable state or side effects.

// In JavaScript, there are several combinators that are commonly used, including:

// Identity Combinator (I Combinator): The Identity Combinator takes an argument and returns it unchanged. Here's an example implementation:

const I = x => x;

// The I Combinator is often used as a placeholder function or a no-op function.

// Kestrel Combinator (K Combinator): The Kestrel Combinator takes two arguments and returns the first argument. Here's an example implementation:

const K = x => y => x;

// The K Combinator is often used to create constant functions that always return a given value, regardless of their arguments.

// Kite Combinator (KI Combinator): The Kite Combinator takes two arguments and returns the second argument. Here's an example implementation:

const KI = x => y => y;

// The KI Combinator is the inverse of the K Combinator and is used to swap arguments or create functions that ignore their first argument.

// Composition Combinator (B Combinator): The Composition Combinator takes two functions and returns a new function that applies the first function to the result of the second function. Here's an example implementation:

const B = f => g => x => f(g(x));

// The B Combinator is often used to create complex functions by combining simpler ones.

// Thrush Combinator (T Combinator): The Thrush Combinator takes an argument and a function and applies the function to the argument. Here's an example implementation:

const T = x => f => f(x);

// The T Combinator is often used to create pipelines of functions that operate on a single input.

// These are just a few of the many combinators that are used in functional programming. By combining these and other combinators, you can create powerful, reusable functions that are easy to reason about and maintain.
